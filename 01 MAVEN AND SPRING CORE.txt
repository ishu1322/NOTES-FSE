01 MAVEN AND SPRING CORE

Maven is a project management tool. It is based on POM.xml Project Object Model.

It is used to add various dependecies, plug-ins and jar files into the project.

NEEDS:
1. No need to manually add jars.
2. Create conventional structure.
3. Easy build and deployment.

POM:
1. Project description:
	modelVersion - should be set to 4.0.0
	groupId - package(com.cts)
	artifactId - project name
	version - the version of the artifact under the specified group
2. Dependencies.


# There are three types of repositories:

Local Repository
Remote Repository
Central Repository

SPRING
-- Framework used for developing JEE applications.
-- Lightweight
-- Used to make program loosely coupled and integrated.

Dependency Injection: 
	Design pattern to make program loosely coupled.

IOC( Inversion Of Control ): 
	Giving control of injecting objects to spring container.

Spring Config file: 
	XML file contains classes info and describe how they are linked to each other.

Constructor and Setter injection
--In constructor injection, partial injection is not allowed whereas it is allowed in setter injection.
-- <property> is used in setter.
-- <contructor-arg> is used in constructor.

Beans:
	These are Objects managed by IOC container. They can be created in xml or using annotations.

Bean Life Cycle:
1. Instantiatesed by IOC container.
2. Populated.
3. Injected as configured.

Autowiring:
Relationship between beans.
